## About Us

PACT Technologies specializes in the research and development of **PACT Modules** — next-generation compliance, audit, and governance systems designed to integrate seamlessly with decentralized and enterprise infrastructures.  

Our mission is to provide **fraud-proof, verifiable, and regulation-compliant modules** that serve governments, enterprises, and decentralized organizations worldwide. From taxation to digital identity, from DeFi compliance to voting, PACT is creating the **operating system for global trust**.

## 🚀 What is PACT?

**PACT** stands for **Proof-Anchored Compliance Technology**.  
It is a modular ecosystem that delivers:

- **Fraud-Proof Protocols** — every transaction, contract, or event can be independently verified or challenged.
- **Regulatory Integration** — modules map directly to tax codes, trade laws, financial regulations, and electoral rules.
- **Composable Architecture** — modules can run standalone or as part of a unified compliance stack.
- **Enterprise & Government Grade** — designed for mission-critical reliability, jurisdictional compliance, and large-scale adoption.

## 🧩 Core PACT Modules

Each module is a **CLI + API + smart contract package** with optional dashboards.  

- **PACT Audit** — tamper-evident audit logs with cryptographic anchoring.  
- **PACT Entity** — decentralized identity & risk profiles using DIDs + vector graphs.  
- **PACT Monitor** — real-time anomaly detection and compliance alerts.  
- **PACT DeFi** — cross-chain DeFi compliance (AML/KYC, sanctions, reporting).  
- **PACT NFT Issuer** — regulated NFT licensing and revocation engine.  
- **PACT Gov** — government policy templates, retention schedules, export packs.  
- **PACT Voting** — fraud-proof, privacy-preserving, compliance-ready voting system.  
- **TaxVault** — automated tax withholding, remittance, and jurisdiction mapping.  
- **PACT AI Wizard** — AI-driven compliance assistant and rules compiler.  

> 🔗 Each module is versioned, open API documented, and interoperable with the PACT OS.
